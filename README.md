Data and Code Repository to accompany the paper: 'Assessing the North-South Divide in Britainâ€™s Digital Landscape through Stable Dynamic Embedding of Spatial Web Data'. 

The datasets used are the Geoindex and Host Link Graphs which can be downloaded from: `https://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/ukwa.ds.2/`. This repository contains the code used to process the files, but not the files themselves.
